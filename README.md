# Advent of Code 2021 in PHP
This repo has code solutions for the Advent of Code 2021. These are not the state-of-the-art solutions. They are quick and dirty. But they work with two ideas in mind: they need to be done as quickly as possible (no overthinking), and they need to work. The solutions should not consume too much resources, but this is not the top priority here.
